# BTCchina

    npm install btcchina

A basic API wrapper for the BTCChina Trading and Market API. 

Please refer to the documentation of the [Trading API](http://btcchina.org/api-trade-documentation-en) and for the [Market API](http://btcchina.org/api-market-data-documentation-en) for all calls explained. Check out `example.js` for a list of all possible calls and their parameters.

    var BTCChina = require('btcchina');
    var btcchina = new BTCChina(key, secret);

    // create an order (API key and secret required)
    var price = 9000;
    var amount = 1;
    btcchina.buyOrder(price, amount, function(err, result) {
      console.log(result);
    });

    // ask the ticker (public API call)
    btcchina.ticker(console.log);
