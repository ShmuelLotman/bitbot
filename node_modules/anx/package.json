ANX provides sandbox environments.\n\nANX implemented a MTGOX v2 compatible implementation for their polling API. This is a fork of https://github.com/ameensol/node-mtgox-apiv2\n\nTo use this, you must have created an API Key on their [website](https://anxpro.com).\n\nThe ANX library is currently transitioning from their MTGOX clone on v2 to a new v3. They have different message formats and standards, please consult:\nConsult http://docs.anxv2.apiary.io and http://docs.anxv3.apiary.io/ for details.\n\nConsult the following URL for decimal places.\n\nhttps://anxpro.com/api/3/currencyStatic\n\n#Credits\n\nAmeen Soleimani for his MTGOX implementation at - https://github.com/ameensol/node-mtgox-apiv2\n\nSee http://github.com/btcdude/anx-sample for sample code.\n",
